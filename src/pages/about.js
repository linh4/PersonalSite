        <h3>My philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          My passion is creating apps to help real people. Technology often intimidates us.  Many people fear the rise of AI will soon make the human experience obsolete.  I disagree!  I personally believe that technology, if done properly, is a tool to supplement human creativity and ingenuity.  For this simple reason my philosophy is to always create sleek user-friendly apps, that are designed to enable users to accomplish very human tasks, with machine efficiency!  Ultimately I want to make my mark on bridging the gap between humans and robots!
